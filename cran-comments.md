## Re submission
- changed the name of the package to match the main function (Rmergetrees -> mergeTrees)
- reset par options to user's options in mergeTrees example

- as.fusionTree title completed (CRAN requirements) 
- add par(mfrow = c(1,1)) at the end (CRAN requirements)
- More comprehensive description field (CRAN requirements)

Thank you for your time and work on CRAN.
